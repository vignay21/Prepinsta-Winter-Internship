# Week 7 Assignment: Tableau Dashboard - India's Air Quality

## Context
Environmental pollution, especially air pollution, is a growing global concern. With 7 million premature deaths annually linked to air pollution, it's crucial to analyze and understand the data. In this Tableau Dashboard project, I explored India's air pollution levels over the years, aiming to correlate changes with environmental policies.

## Dashboard Components

### 1. Map Visualization
- Geographical maps display air quality levels across Indian states.
- Color-coded markers based on Air Quality Index (AQI) offer visual clarity.

### 2. Time Series Charts
- Time series line charts showcase air quality changes over the years.
- Data grouped by months or years to identify patterns and trends.

### 3. Policy Change Timeline
- Integrated timeline component highlighting key environmental policy changes.
- Correlate these events with air quality variations.

### 4. Filter Options
- User-friendly filters for selecting specific states, periods, or pollutant types.
- Customizable views based on user interests or research questions.

### 5. Comparative Analysis
- Comparative charts illustrate air quality differences between states or regions.
- Bar charts or line charts showcase variations in air quality metrics.

### 6. Top Pollutant Analysis
- Identification and display of top pollutants contributing to poor air quality.
- Bar charts or pie charts represent the proportion of each pollutant.

### 7. Insightful Annotations
- Annotations highlight specific data points, events, or trends.
- Context and explanations provided for better understanding.

## Brief About Dataset
- Combined and cleaned version of Historical Daily Ambient Air Quality Data by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Central Pollution Control Board of India.
- Key dimensions: Stn_code, Sampling_Date, State, Location, Agency, location_monitoring_station, pm2_5, Date, Type.
- Key measures: So2 (Sulfur dioxide), No2 (Nitrogen dioxide), Rspm (Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter), Spm (Suspended Particulate Matter).

## Air Quality Measurements
- **So2 & No2:** Most dangerous outdoor air pollutants.
- **RSPM:** Produced from combustion processes, vehicles, and industrial sources.

## Steps to Build the Dashboard
1. Connect to Data
2. Design Dashboard Layout
3. Create Worksheets
4. Apply Filters
5. Implement Interactivity
6. Timeline Integration
7. Map Integration
8. Test and Refine
9. Document Insights
10. Publish and Share

Excited to present a comprehensive Tableau Dashboard for exploring India's air pollution levels and their correlation with environmental policies. Join me in the journey of data-driven insights! üåçüìà
