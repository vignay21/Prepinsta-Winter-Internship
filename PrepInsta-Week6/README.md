# Overview of Data Analysis for Week 6

## Datasets

### Indian Cars Dataset
- This dataset provides information on passenger car sales in the Indian market.
- The analysis involves utilizing Python and visualization libraries for both univariate and bivariate analysis.

### Superstore Sales Dataset
- A comprehensive retail sales dataset from a global superstore spanning four years.
- Similar analysis approaches as the Indian Cars dataset, focusing on understanding data structure, cleaning, and exploring relationships.

## Analysis Tasks

### Univariate Analysis
1. **Data Exploration:** Delve into the dataset's structure, clean and assess data types.
2. **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculate and visualize descriptive statistics to gain insights.
3. **Histograms and Bar Charts:** Employ visualizations to understand the distributions of key variables.
4. **Time Series Plots:** Investigate trends over time within the Superstore Sales dataset.

### Bivariate Analysis
1. **Correlation Examination:** Analyze relationships between variables to identify connections.
2. **Scatter Plots and Pair Plots:** Visualize relationships between numeric variables using effective plotting techniques.
3. **Categorical Plots:** Explore the impact of categorical variables on sales through visualizations.
4. **Insights and Documentation:** Summarize crucial findings and insights derived from the analyses.

## Tools Utilized
- Python
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

Both analyses aim to reveal patterns, trends, and relationships in the data, providing valuable insights for further interpretation or modeling.
